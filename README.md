# music-production
A webpage about music production! It lists some of the equipment I use and a bit of information regarding my workflow. I used flexbox for the first time here and seperated all the sections into horizontal panels and added in embedded soundcloud players.

Using today.get I declared values for the day, month and year. Then using DOM Manipulation and expressions for each value I pushed the string into each '<p>' element. Media queries were used to then alter the display at descending screen width intervals to reduce the amount of cards on the screen and their widths and alter the font sizing of the headings.
