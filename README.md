# Music Production

A webpage about music production! It lists some of the equipment I use and a bit of information regarding my workflow. I used flexbox for the first time here and separated all the sections into horizontal panels and added in embedded SoundCloud players.

Using today.get I declared values for the day, month and year. Then using DOM Manipulation and expressions for each value I pushed the string into each paragraph element. Media queries were used to then alter the display at descending screen width intervals to reduce the number of cards on the screen and their widths and alter the font sizing of the headings.
