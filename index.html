        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I've been producing music for nearly a decade, starting as a passing
          interest and eventually growing into an obsession in the last 5
          years. I've been fortunate enough to have my music released on vinyl
          and to have played gigs in both London and Bristol.
          <br />
          <br />
          For the most part I produce dubstep, with my biggest influences being
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLoB9aYdu8" target="_blank"
            >Headland</a
          >,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obekLd4rZN4" target="_blank"
            >Causa</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://youtu.be/T2Chnev4klI" target="_blank"
            >Digital Mystikz</a
          >. I often dabble in Halftime Jungle too with
          <a href="https://youtu.be/hlo0PRMFWOg" target="_blank"
            >Homemade Weapons</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://youtu.be/MoJStt8yZ5Y" target="_blank">TORN</a> being
          major influences. I'm drawn to genres with a lot of space, rhythm and
          tension.

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Ableton Push:</b> a midi controller to sequence melodies, beats
            and parameter automation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mackie MR5 MKII Monitors:</b> active two-way monitors to
            reference audio with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro Headphones:</b> a firm favourite for music producers, sound engineers and broadcasters. 
            These closed back headphones have a great bass response and strong noise isolation. 
            Fitted with velour earpads, they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface:</b> an audio interface
            with 2 inputs for recording external instruments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Ableton Live 11: </b> my DAW (digital audio workstation) of
            choice, heavily focused on a frictionless workflow to flesh out
            tracks quickly while the ideas are fresh!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Glue:</b> an analog modeled compressor plug-in based on The
            classic 80's British big console buss compressor, great for
            controlling drums and 'gluing' them together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Valhalla VintageVerb:</b> inspired by the classic hardware
            digital reverbs of the 70s and 80s, VintageVerb has a wide array of
            modelled rooms and springs to choose from that make it really easy
            getting that nice old dusty reverb sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>u-he Twangström:</b> you can't make spacey dubstep without a
            spring reverb, and although nothing's as good as the real deal,
            Twangström comes very close.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>xfer Serum:</b> the bread and butter synth of the vast majority of
            electronic music producers, Serum is a wavetable synthesizer with
            frequency modulation capabilities..
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          I find that the tracks I'm most happy with end up being the ones that
          are started and finished within the space of a few days. The longer
          it's drawn out, the harder it is to maintain the creative headspace
          you were in when you first started, so having a frictionless creative
          workflow is imperative. Ableton opens in a template I have iterated
          over and over through the years, with my default channels for drums,
          synths, fx etc. already set up with my go-to plug-ins. For
          instance, having 2 separate reverb send channels; a large hall and a plate
          reverb, allows me to send my instruments to reverbs with settings
          already dialed in for the space they require.
          <br />
          <br />
          Separating sound design and writing into their own sessions is another
          massive help, there's nothing worse than getting hung up trying to
          create the perfect bass sound for hours and squandering your creative
          flow-state, making it harder to move forward with the musicality and
          arrangement of the track. On days when I'm not feeling too creative, I
          try and spend my time synthesizing bass sounds and creating
          interesting distortion, reverb and delay patches, much like a painter
          would mix a palette before starting a painting. Not only does this
          save you the hassle of getting too fiddly when you're trying to write
          and arrange tracks but also slowly nurtures your own signature sound
          over time that sets you apart from your peers.

        <h2>Releases</h2>
        <p>
          So far, I have been fortunate enough to have two releases pressed to
          vinyl, both EPs out on Encrypted Audio.
