      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="textBody">
        I've been producing music for nearly a decade, starting as a passing
        interest and eventually growing into an obsession for the last 5 years.
        I've been fortunate enough to have my music released on vinyl and played
        gigs in London and Bristol.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the most part I produce dubstep, with my biggest influences being
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLoB9aYdu8" target="_blank"
          >Headland</a
        >,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obekLd4rZN4" target="_blank"
          >Causa</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://youtu.be/T2Chnev4klI" target="_blank"
          >Digital Mystikz</a
        >. I often dabble in Halftime Jungle too with
        <a href="https://youtu.be/hlo0PRMFWOg" target="_blank"
          >Homemade Weapons</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://youtu.be/MoJStt8yZ5Y" target="_blank">TORN</a> being
        major influences. I'm drawn to genres with alot of space, rhythm and
        tension.

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Ableton Push:</b> a midi controller to sequence melodies, beats and
          automation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mackie MR5 MKII Monitors:</b> active two‑way monitors to reference
          audio with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface:</b> an audio interface with
          2 inputs for recording external instruments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Ableton Live 11: </b> my DAW (digital audio workstation) of choice,
          heavily focused on a frictionless workflow to flesh out tracks quickly
          while the ideas are fresh!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Glue:</b> an analog modeled compressor plug-in based on The
          classic 80's British big console buss compressor, great for
          controlling drums and 'glueing' them together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Valhalla VintageVerb:</b> inspired by the classic hardware digital
          reverbs of the 70s and 80s, VintageVerb has a wide array of modelled
          rooms and springs to choose from that make it really easy getting that
          nice old dusty reverb sound.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>u-he Twangström:</b> you can't make spacey dubstep without a spring
          reverb, and although nothing's as good as the real deal, Twangström
          comes very close.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>xfer Serum:</b> the bread and butter of the vast majority of
          electronic music producers, Serum is a wavetable synthesizer with
          frequency modulation capabilites.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="textBody">
      <h2>Workflow</h2>
      <p class="textBody">
        I find that the tracks I'm most happy with end up being the ones that
        are started and finished within the space of a few days. The longer it's
        drawn out, the harder it is to maintain the creative headspace you were
        in when you first started, so having a frictionless creative workflow is
        imperitive. Ableton opens in a template I have iterated over and over
        through the years, with my go-to channels for drums, synths, fx etc.
        already set up with my go-to plug-ins on. For instance, having 2
        seperate reverb channels; a large hall and a plate reverb, allows me to
        send my instruments to reverbs with settings already dialled in for the
        space they require.
        <br />
        <br />
        Seperating sound design and writing into their own sessions is another
        massive help, there's nothing worse than getting hung up trying to
        create the perfect bass sound for hours and squandering your creative
        headspace, making it harder to move forward with the musicality and
        arrangement of the track. On days when I'm not feeling too creative I
        try and spend my time synthesising bass sounds and creating interesting
        distortion, reverb and delay patches, much like a pianter would mix a
        pallete before starting a painting. Not only does this save you the
        hassle of getting too fiddly when you're trying to write and arrange
        tracks but also slowly nurtures your own signature sound over time that
        sets you apart from your peers.

      <h2>Releases</h2>
      <p class="textBody">
        So far I have been fortunate enough to have to releases pressed to
        vinyl, both EP's out on Encrypted Audio.
